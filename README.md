# Fine-tuned BERT Model for Sentiment Classification

This repository contains the fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification using the **NTC-SCV** dataset. The model is trained for sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's **Transformers** library and is ready for deployment.

## Full Resources

Since the model size is too large to upload directly to GitHub, you can download the full resources (model and tokenizer) from the following link:

You can use the model and tokenizer to easily integrate sentiment analysis into your own applications.

## Demo

Here is a short demo of the sentiment classification app that uses the fine-tuned BERT model.
